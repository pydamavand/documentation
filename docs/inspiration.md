This package is named after **Mount Damavand** in Iran.  
Damavand is not only the **highest mountain peak in Iran**, but also a **national symbol of strength, endurance, and steadiness** — an image that recurs across Persian literature, myth, and travel writing.
May this package carry forward not just its name, but also a share of the resilience and endurance that Damavand has long stood for.

## Appearance of Damavand in Artistry

As both a natural wonder and a cultural symbol, Damavand has inspired countless works of literature, music, and visual art across centuries. Below are selected examples that reflect its presence in Persian artistry.

### Damavand in Persian Literature  

Below are three notable, precisely rendered references to Damavand from Persian sources (original Persian lines followed by a careful *literal* translation and a more natural contemporary English rendering). Each entry includes a short note on context.

#### [Ferdowsi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdowsi) — *Shāhnāmeh* (10th–11th century)  

In Ferdowsi’s epic, the *Shāhnāmeh*, Damavand becomes the eternal prison of **Zahhāk**, a mythical tyrant defeated by the hero Fereydun.  

> بیآورد ضحاک را چون نوند  
> به کوه دماوند کردش به بند  

**English translation:**  
“They quickly brought Zahhāk and chained him within Mount Damavand.”

#### [Nāṣir-i Khusraw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasir_Khusraw) — *Safarnāmeh* (11th century)  

The philosopher and traveler Nāṣir-i Khusraw describes Damavand not in myth, but in reality — as a towering dome between Ray and Amol, known for its mineral wealth.  

> و میان ری و آمل کوه دماوند است مانند گنبدی و آن را لواسان گویند، و گویند بر سر آن چاهیست که نوشادر از آن حاصل می‌شود و گویند که کبریت نیز، و مردم پوست گاو ببرند و پر نوشادر کنند و از سر کوه بغلتانند که به راه نتوان فرود آوردن.  

**English translation:**  
“Between Ray and Amol stands Mount Damavand, dome-like. They say on its summit lies a source of natron and sulphur; people fill cowhides with the mineral and roll them down the mountain since the steep paths prevent carrying them down.”

---

#### [Mohammad-Taqi Bahār](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad-Taqi_Bahar) — *Damāvandieh* (early 20th century)  

The modern poet Bahār personifies Damavand as a chained giant — snow-capped, iron-girdled, yet unyielding — a powerful symbol of resistance and endurance.  

> ای دیو سپید پای در بند  
> ای گنبد گیتی ای دماوند  
>   
> از سیم به سر، یکی کله‌خود  
> ز آهن به میان یکی کمربند  

**English translation:**  
“O Damavand — white giant, bound at the feet; a silvery helm crowns your head, and an iron girdle clasps your waist.”
