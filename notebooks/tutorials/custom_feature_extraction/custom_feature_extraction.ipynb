Damavand simplifies the extraction of a wide range of [features](https://github.com/amirberenji1995/damavand/blob/main/documentations/signal_processing.md#features-to-extract). through the employment of a Python function as [`feature_extractor`](https://github.com/amirberenji1995/damavand/blob/main/documentations/signal_processing.md#feature_extractorsignals-features). This function takes a collection of features as key-value pairs of the following format:\n","\n","```python\n","features = {\n","  'feature_name': (feature, (args), {kwargs})\n","}\n","```\n","In this notation, `feature`, `args` and `kwargs` are the feature implemented as a Python function, tuple of its positional arguments and the dict of keyword arguments.\n","\n","Once such dictionary is declared, the `feature_extractor` function can be used easily as below:\n","\n","```python\n","from numpy import mean, std\n","from damavand.damavand.signal_processing.feature_extraction import rms, feature_extractor\n","\n","features = {\n","  'mean': (mean, (), {}),\n","  'std': (std, (), {}),\n","  'rms': (rms, (), {}),\n","}\n","\n","# Assuming the desired signals are stored in the `signals` variable\n","features_df = feature_extractor(signals, features)\n","```\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"et8o9PIZt9id"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 2.
